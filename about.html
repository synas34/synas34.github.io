        <h2>About Nasir Ahmed</h2>
        <p>I'm a transportation engineer & software developer specializing in agent-based simulation, urban planning, and transportation modeling using AI.
            My work focuses on creating cutting-edge simulations, data analyses, and prediction models that help city planners, engineers, and policy-makers make better cities, transportation networks and communities.
        Until 2022 I was a civil engineer working at a variety of enterprises, with work ranging from finite Element Analysis on offshore wind turbines to bidding for road sign projects.
        From 2022-2024 I completed a research-based masters at the University of Tokyo where I created a multi-modal simulation of Tokyo from scratch, gaining exceptional skill in transportation simulation and large scale Java applications.
        I augmented this main thrust with several projects varying from AI-prediction models of urban growth patterns and consulting with development companies on urban design problems.</p>

        <p>I'm always open to freelance projects, collaborations, and research opportunities. Feel free to reach out!</p>
