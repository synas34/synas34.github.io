        <h1> This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website</h1>

        <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

        <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

        <p><strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong></p>

        <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that grotesque pile of shit into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

        <p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. </br>Here's how.</p>

        <h2>Let it breathe</h2>

        <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
        <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

        <h2>A little less contrast</h2>

        <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

        <h2>Size Matters</h2>

        <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

        <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

        <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

        <h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

        <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
